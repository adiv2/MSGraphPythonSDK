# MSGraphPythonSDK
Created this sample code for using Graph API python SDK. Current Microsoft docs are confusing and have minor errors.  With this code you can make api calls using just the request URL, fetch particular fields from the response, recursively handle odata.nextLink, and also export the output to csv.
